## About The Project

This is a simple case study on Olympic archer shooting scores since 1992 --- when they implemented the knock-out tournament style to the Olympics for Individual Men's competition. Rather unfortunate for U.S. archer Brady Elison, whose outstanding performances fall just short of the elusive gold.
